## What is OpenVASP?

**VASP** stands for *Virtual Asset Service Provider*.
OpenVASP is an open protocol to implement FATF's travel rule for virtual assets.

The protocol facilitates robust compliance for VASPs, solely based on a set of principles, regardless of jurisdiction or virtual asset and without membership or registration with a centralized third-party.
